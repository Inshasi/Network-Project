# Computer Networks Lab Final Project

## Project Overview:
This project sets up a network with three routers, three switches, 11 PCs, and a server. The goal is to establish a functional network with specific configurations, including VLANs, IP addresses, DHCP, routing, and access control.

## Components:
- 3 routers
- 3 switches
- 11 PCs
- 1 server

## Configuration:
- **IP Addresses**: Assigned to PCs, routers, and the server.
- **VLANs**: Configured on switches.
- **DHCP**: Setup for VLANs 100 and 200.
- **Routing**: Implemented using RIP.
- **Security**: Passwords and access controls applied.

## Testing:
- Telnet tested for Q12.
- NAT and PAT tested for successful pinging.
- Access control tested for security.

## Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the setup of a secure and efficient network infrastructure, emphasizing thoughtful design and adherence to specific configurations.
